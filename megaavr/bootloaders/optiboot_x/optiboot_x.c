  //  4/24/21 Spence Konde:
  //  It *also* relies on the peripherals not being configured in an adverse way.
  //  Everything is written with the assumption that we start out after a reset.
  //  So what do we do when we can see that it isn't arriving from a reset, because RSTFR is 0?
  //
  //  Previously we just made sure not to try to jump to the app in that case.
  //  Largely because in non-reset-pin configurations, after running the bootloader once,
  //  instead of continually running the bootloader until something was uploaded, it would do it
  //  once, and then hit no entry conditions and jump to (the non-existent) app, run off the
  //  end of the flash, and repeat (discovered 11/14/20)
  //
  //  Now, ~unless we are told that we should ASSUME_DIRECT_ENTRY_SAFE~, when we detect something
  //  that could be either execution running past the end of an empty flash, a direct entry
  //  attempt, or some dreadful error condition, that is, when we find no reset cause we do
  //  what the app should have and fire a software reset. Net cost 10-12 bytes, but we have 32 left
  //  after that. As of 1/1/2023, I have removed ASSUME_DIRECT_ENTRY_SAFE, on the grounds that I don't
  //  think that even a tenth of a percent of users have any idea what they would need to do to make
  //  that be true. It's like an ASSUME_SKY_IS_GREEN option - yes it is theoretically possible -
  //  for example, near the poles, at night, under a bright Aurora, the sky may indeed be green.
  //  but it is an outlandish thing to assume. ASSUME_DIRECT_ENTRY_SAFE essentially translates as
  //  ASSUME_DEVELOPER_KNOWS_EVERY_REGISTER_USED_BY_OPTIBOOT_AND_RESET_THEM_ALL - which is even
  //  more outlandish than ASSUME_SKY_IS_GREEN, because the latter would be true without specific
  //  effort from the app writer under some conditions which will occur in practice. In contrast,
  //  the core guarantees that the former will never be true unless the developer has made a great
  //  effort here.
  //  This would take a considerably larger amount of flash relative to the small 8-10 byte footprint
  //  of a software reset.
  //
  //  The clock speed must be set to the POR default (div/6) (10 bytes)
  //  If the internal oscillator calibration was changed, that must be reset to the factory cal
  //  (or something that is closer than the factory cal to the nominal osc speed). (12 bytes,
  //  if this was ever changed)
  //  If an external clock was used, we must switch back to internal (10 bytes)
  //  The UART used by the bootloader must be made safe, meaning the following members for the UART
  //  struct: CTRLB (this gets written, but we need to start with it disabled), EVCTRL, TXPLCTRL
  //  RXPLCTRL should be zero'ed out, and STATUS should be read and written back. (16 bytes)
  //  Interrupts must be disabled. (2 bytes)
  //  PINnCTRL for the two pins must be zero'ed out if you had either pin inverted (2 bytes per)
  //  The jump takes 4 bytes.
  //  That means for overhead penalty of between 6 and 34 bytes added to app binary size, which is usable
  //  for other code, you would be able to....  ... enter the bootloader less robustly, and save 10 bytes
  //  in the bootloader, where you can't use it.

     Erase and write page with
